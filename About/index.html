    <p>Greetings! I am Danielle, a software engineer based in Seattle.
       I completed a Bachelor of Science (Applied Mathematics) with a Concurrent
       Diploma in Informatics (Computer Science) at the University of Melbourne.
       Currently I am working as a software engineer at Microsoft, where I am part of
       the Azure Performance and Reliability team, building solutions that
       enhance the latency and reliability of Azure Compute stack.
       <br><br>
       My interests lie in the intersection of mathematics and software engineering.
       I am always looking for opportunities to make creative and impactful
       solutions with my mathematical and logical rigor.
       I am also interested in the ethics, diversity and social consequences of tech.
       I believe that we as technologists need to be conscious of the responsibilty
       to build ethical and social tech products. And to achieve this, we need
       a diverse pool of talents behind these products.
       <br><br>
       When I am not coding away, you may find me in my natural habitat:
       long-distance running (literally running away from my problems) and
       making baked goods with my sourdough starter Breadtrand Russell.
